Summary
================

Redundans pipeline assist assembly of heterozygous genomes. 
It consists of three steps/modules:
1. redundancy reduction: detection and selectively removal of redundant contigs from an initial *de novo* assembly
2. scaffolding 
3. gap closing

While just genome assembly is enough to proceed with reduction step, paired-end and/or mate-pair libraries are required for scaffolding and gap closing. 

Redundans is: 
* **modular**, thus every step can be ommited or replaced with another tools. 
* **flexible** toward any sequencing technology (i.e. Illumina, 454 or Sanger). 

Prerequisites
================
* Python 2.7+
* Biopython 1.6+
* BWA
* pysam
* SSPACE2
* some **de novo** genome assembler ie SOAPdenovo2 or SPAdes
